    What is Outh2???
    ================
    If you notice Facebook or Twitter apps or you are using a third party application to access Facebook or Twitter. So
    you used to get a notification saying do you want to authorize this particular application. so that is all done by
    using oauth2. Now see How it is helping Facebook, Twitter and other tch giants in accessing our information from some
    source.
    Oauth is basically a open standard for access delegation. so it is not for authentication only it is for access delegation.
    so basically you delegate your authority to somebody else. So that is what Oauth does in general.
    So it is not an authentication protocol or something like that it is an authorization standard.

    It is also provide the secure delegated access. Lets say you have an google account. now you are accessing a bank
    statement. now Bank statement asks you provide a google account and you get redirected to the google page and from
    there google asks you whether you want to authorize your bank to redirect or give information about you to the bank.
    So that is what happens in Oauth2. Literally the bank won't have your username and password from google instead it will
    ust delegate the URL or the request to google and google will authenticate you and google will ask you what all accesses
    do you need to give the bank. So basically the authorization infromation is received from google to the bank and the bank then
    and the bank then uses that too for any further communication.
